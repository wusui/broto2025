# Baseball Statistics Scraper

Read box scores from ESPN site for each day.  Stash daily statistics as a json list of dictionaries where each entry is
the complete set of statistics for a player that day.

## TO DO

Implement a "grabber" of statistics for a given time period that gathers the stats, sums all the values, calculates
averages, and presents the output in a human readable form.

Still need to collect the following data:
- RISP averages
- Correct batting HBP numbers
- Correct pitching HBP numbers
- Defensive DP turned
- Defensive TP turned
- Extra base hits allowed
- Defensive battery SB
- Defensive battery CS
- Defensive pickoffs
-
